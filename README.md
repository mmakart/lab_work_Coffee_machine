# lab_work_Coffee_machine

## Description

It's a lab work made by me at the Siberian Automobile and Highway Institution at the Information Management System faculty.

## Using

It's a console application representing a virtual coffee machine. It has 3 containers which can keep coffee, water and milk ingredients. After starting the program they contain no resources. You need to type the command `load <resource> <number>` where resource is one of `coffee`, `water` and `milk`.

Also the machine can produce 3 recipes of coffee (listed below). They only differ in the amount of coffee, water and milk needed. So, type the command `brew <type>` where `type` is one of `cappuccino`, `espresso`, `filtered` and `americano`. If there are enough ingredients, you will see a message that you coffee is done.
